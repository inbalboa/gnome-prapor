## Features

It's like the system GNOME Shell layout indicator, but with flags.

## Requirements

- GNOME Shell 48+

## Installation

### From GNOME Extensions

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8494/prapor-keyboard-layout-indicator/

### Manual Installation

1. **Download and install the extension files**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/inbalboa/gnome-prapor.git
   cd gnome-prapor
   make install
   ```
   Requires `git`, `make`, `jq`

2. **Restart GNOME Shell**

   Log out and log back in.

3. **Enable the extension**
   ```sh
   gnome-extensions enable prapor@inbalboa.github.io
   ```

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the flag icon in the top panel shows your current keyboard layout.

Click the flag to open a dropdown menu with all available layouts.

You can still use your regular keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Super + Space`) to switch layouts.

## Configuration

You can hide the system keyboard layout indicator (with letters) in the extension settings page.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Showing
- Ensure GNOME Shell version is 48 or higher
- Check that the extension is enabled: `gnome-extensions list --enabled`
- Restart GNOME Shell

### Wrong Flag Displayed
- The extension maps layouts based on their identifier
- Some layouts may use generic identifiers that don't map perfectly to countries
- Unknown layouts will display a keyboard emoji (⌨️)

### No Layouts in Menu
- Ensure you have multiple keyboard layouts configured in Settings
- Check that Input Sources are properly configured
- Restart the extension: disable and re-enable it
